mailgun_magento
===============

Avoid spam folders, track opens, clicks, bounces, and spam reports. This Magento extension configures your store to send all transactional emails via Mailgun. Mailgun optimizes your emails so they are sure to reach your customers inbox. The extension uses Mailgun's Web API (rather than the SMTP API) so it will work on hosts (HostGator, SiteGround, BlueHost, etc) that block 3rd party SMTP services.
